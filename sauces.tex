\paragraph{Items}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item[\ding{182}] A pinch of green tea powder.
    \item[\ding{183}] $1$ teaspoon of dijon mustard.
    \item[\ding{184}] $1$ teaspoon of medium mustard.
    \item[\ding{185}] $1$ egg.
    \item[\ding{186}] $100$ ml sunflower oil.
    \item[\ding{187}] Lemon juice or a small lemon.
    \item[\ding{188}] Salt and pepper.
    
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Instruction}
In the pursuit of crafting the perfect mayonnaise, the journey begins by placing a single egg into our bowl. To this, we add the zestful juice of half a small lemon, alongside the robust notes of Dijon mustard and the medium heat of another mustard variant. As a subtle yet enchanting twist, a mere pinch of finely ground green tea powder, seasoned judiciously with salt and pepper, is gently integrated into the mix. With all elements thoughtfully assembled, we initiate the delicate choreography by commencing the whisking process, all the while introducing a slow drizzle of sunflower oil. Alternatively, the choice of rapeseed oil may be considered, provided it maintains a modest and unobtrusive flavor profile. If, in pursuit of expediency, a handheld immersion blender is enlisted, it should be lowered gently over the egg yolk, akin to a protective canopy, before being set to the highest speed. These meticulous actions persist until the amalgamation of ingredients transforms into a cohesive, velvety paste—an unequivocal testament to the completion of our exquisite mayonnaise.

This mayonnaise, while already a masterpiece in its own right, beckons culinary exploration and personalization. It is a versatile canvas upon which flavor nuances may be deftly painted. For those inclined toward the savory, a clove of garlic imparts a hearty, robust direction, while the inclusion of a chili pepper lends a fiery, piquant note. The addition of a trace of Hoisin sauce or Sriracha sauce, on the other hand, introduces an umami richness or a gentle spiciness, respectively, providing the discerning palate with a spectrum of tantalizing possibilities.

\section{Raspberry Chutney}
\label{raspberrychuttney}
The raspberry chutney serves as a versatile cornerstone for various sauces and can effortlessly transform into a delectable burger condiment when harmoniously blended with mayonnaise (as per reference \ref{mayonnaise}). Yet, its culinary prowess extends further, as it graciously lends itself to the role of a standalone accompaniment, ideally paired with rich, dark meat dishes such as those featuring succulent cuts of red meat or venison.

Intriguingly, this recipe holds the capacity for diverse adaptations. One may elect to replace raspberries with an array of alternatives, including blackberries, blueberries, gooseberries, strawberries, or black cherries, each contributing its unique character to the symphony of flavors. For those seeking a seasonal twist, a wintertime rendition incorporating oranges or a summery variation featuring the tangy essence of bitter oranges presents itself as an enticing option, expanding the culinary horizons and inviting the palate on a delightful journey of exploration.

This recipe makes \emph{$2$ servings}. It takes about \emph{$15$ minutes} and has an \emph{easy} level of difficulty. 

\paragraph{Items}
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item[\ding{182}] $300$ g of raspberries.
    \item[\ding{183}] 1 onion.
    \item[\ding{184}] 1 tablespoon of brown sugar.
    \item[\ding{185}] 1 tablespoon of rice vinegar.
    \item[\ding{186}] 1 chilli.
    \item[\ding{187}] 2 tablespoons of olive oil.
    \item[\ding{188}] 3 tablespoons of soy sauce.
    \item[\ding{189}] Salt, pepper and cinnamon.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Instruction}
Commence by selecting a medium-sized pot and placing it over a medium flame. Pour the olive oil into the pot, allowing it to gradually warm within its confines. While the olive oil gently heats, shift your focus to the chili pepper. Aim for meticulous precision as you finely mince it, then incorporate it into the warming oil. A patient interval of five to seven minutes is imperative during this phase, affording the oil ample time to absorb the fiery essence of the chili. It's worth noting that the degree of spiciness can be customized to your personal preferences; nevertheless, Thai chilies are highly recommended for achieving the desired fiery crescendo in the chutney.

Following this, add the finely chopped onions to the pot, allowing them to sauté gently until they reach a state of translucent translucence. Once this transformation is accomplished, introduce the brown sugar to the pan. Gradually increase the heat, fostering the gradual caramelization of the sugar. Await the juncture when the onions are enveloped in a delicate caramel layer, their complexion evolving into a sumptuous shade of golden brown. Now, it is time to elegantly integrate the raspberries into this flavorful amalgamation. Whether opting for fresh or frozen raspberries, both are suitable choices. However, please bear in mind that the cooking duration may experience a slight variance in the case of frozen berries due to their added water content. Concurrently, introduce the rice vinegar and soy sauce to the ensemble. Permit the chutney to gently simmer over a medium flame.

As a final act of culinary alchemy, pour a glass of tap water into the pot, then reduce the heat. With intermittent stirring, the broth should steadily condense, yielding a luxuriously thick and creamy texture. In the closing moments, delicately season the chutney with a dash of cinnamon, judiciously applied salt, and a pinch of pepper. Exercise restraint with the salt, for the soy sauce already contributes a substantial sodium quotient to the concoction.
