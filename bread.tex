	    \item[\ding{185}] 2 cups lukewarm water (around 43°C).
	\end{itemize}
	\item For the seasoning:
	\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
	    \item[\ding{182}] 2 tablespoons olive oil.
	    \item[\ding{183}] 1 tablespoon dried rosemary.
	    \item[\ding{184}] 1 tablespoon dried thyme.
	    \item[\ding{185}] 1 teaspoon garlic powder.
	    \item[\ding{186}] $\frac{1}{2}$ teaspoon smoked paprika.
	    \item[\ding{187}] $\frac{1}{2}$ teaspoon black pepper.
	    \item[\ding{188}] $\frac{1}{2}$ teaspoon sea salt flakes.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Instruction}
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
	\item \textbf{Activate the yeast:} In a small bowl, combine the lukewarm water and yeast. Let it sit for about 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy. This indicates that the yeast is active and ready to use.
	\item \textbf{Mix the dry ingredients:} In a large mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour and salt. Create a well in the center of the flour mixture.
	\item \textbf{Combine the wet and dry ingredients:} Pour the activated yeast mixture into the well you created in the flour. Stir until a shaggy dough forms.
	\item \textbf{Knead the dough:} Turn the dough out onto a floured surface and knead it for about 10 minutes until it becomes smooth and elastic. You can add a little more flour if the dough is too sticky.
	\item \textbf{First rise:} Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a clean kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm, draft-free place for about 1-2 hours, or until it has doubled in size.
	\item \textbf{Preheat the oven:} If you have a pizza stone or baking stone, place it in your oven and preheat it to 230°C. If you don't have a stone, you can use a cast-iron skillet or a heavy baking sheet.
	\item \textbf{Shape the dough:} Punch down the risen dough and shape it into a round or oval loaf. Place it on a piece of parchment paper.
	\item \textbf{Season the bread:} In a small bowl, mix together the olive oil, dried rosemary, dried thyme, garlic powder, smoked paprika, and black pepper. Brush this mixture generously over the surface of the bread. Sprinkle sea salt flakes on top.
	\item \textbf{Second rise:} Cover the bread with a kitchen towel and let it rise for an additional 30 minutes while your oven continues to preheat.
	\item \textbf{Bake:} Carefully transfer the bread (along with the parchment paper) onto the preheated stone or skillet in the oven. Bake for 30-35 minutes or until the bread is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.
	\item \textbf{Cool:} Allow the bread to cool on a wire rack for at least 30 minutes before slicing. This will help the interior set properly.
\end{enumerate}
Enjoy your homemade rustic bread with the flavors of a wood-fired oven! It's perfect for serving with olive oil and balsamic vinegar or as a side with soups and stews.
